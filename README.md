# Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship

**Name:** Rishik Kurkiya


**Task:** Machine Learning Internship Task 1
I have implemented The Task -- **SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA DATA** on the IMDB dataset available on keggle. 
For this, I have implemented Naive Bayes, Logistic Regressions, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and AdaBoost Machine Learning models. 
You can find the code for this task in the SentimentAnalysis_ML.ipynb file uploaded in the repository, (Note that the dataset in the .ipynb file is impored from my drive, in order to run it you will have to download dataset from keggle)

**Task:** Machine Learning Internship Task 2
I have implemented The Task -- **IMAGE CLASSIFICATION FOR FOOD RECOGNITION** on the Food41 dataset available on keggle. 
For this, I have implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model.
You can find the code for this task in the Food_Classification.ipynb file uploaded in the repository, (Note that the dataset in the .ipynb file is impored from my drive, in order to run it you will have to download dataset from keggle)
